# R files of the numerical experiments of "Learning CHARME models with DNN"

1.- If you want to reproduce the results, first download all R files of this repository. Then, open "DNN-CHARME.Rmd" with [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/). 
This is an Rmarkdown that you can compile chunk by chuck (Recommended because there are certain experiments that take a long time to run).

2.- You can just look at the results already executed on the html document: "DNN-CHARME.html".
