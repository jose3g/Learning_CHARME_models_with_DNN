# R notebook of the numerical experiments of "Learning CHARME models with DNN"

In order to use the R notebook, first download the folder called "R notebooks CHARME" included in this repository. 

Once the folder is downloaded in your computer, you can see the code by clicking on "DNN-CHARME.nb.html" in that folder.



If you want to reproduce the results, open "DNN-CHARME.Rmd" with [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/). 

Attention: Do not forget before running the "DNN-CHARME.Rmd" experiments of running all the functions of "Requeriments.Rmd".
